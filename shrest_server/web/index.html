Analytics<br><p>
Data is only valuable if you have the ability to refine it into something actionable. Your CRM needs to be able to do more than simply gather and store massive amounts of information; it needs to be able to mine that information, analyze it, and quickly present clear and understandable conclusions that can be used to inform future business decisions.</p>
Customization<br><p>
Your business has its own unique challenges. Your customers have their own unique needs. So it doesn’t make much sense for you to be using a CRM that can’t be customized to suit your unique situation. A flexible CRM is one that allows you to sync it with your operating systems, gives you full control over what kind of data is being mined, and makes it possible for you to update and reevaluate your processes as you go. Remember: Your CRM should be working for you, not the other way around.</p>
Simplicity<br><p>
Despite all of the advantages of investing in CRM, the fact of the matter is that CRM won’t increase your revenue by a single cent unless your employees are willing to use it. For this reason, finding a CRM that is easy to understand, intuitive to use, and straightforward in its reports may make all of the difference. Don’t take on more than you can handle, because an over-complicated CRM may be just as bad as having no CRM at all.</p>
Contact Management
<p>
Have a complete view of your customers, including activity history, key contacts, customer communications, and internal account discussions. </p>

<p>
Opportunity Management
Get all the details on your team’s deals — stage, products, competition, quotes, and more. Stay connected to the people and information you need to close every sale.</p>


<p>
iCRM Engage
Connect your iCRM to customers in just one click with personalised sales campaigns designed by marketing. You’ll be able to understand how prospects are engaging, and use real-time sales alerts to strike while the iron is hot.</p>

<p>
Workflow automation lets you streamline the sales, marketing, and support processes. Write your own rules. Simplify your sales follow-ups based on your unique business needs. Automatically assign leads and customers to the reps best qualified to handle them. Improve the efficiency of salespeople by eliminating redundant steps while updating records, triggering email notifications etc. at the right time. And grow your business through standardizing working methods at reduced operating costs.
</p>
<p>

<p>
Lead management is an important business process that combines tools with techniques to enable effective leads generation, management and tracking of new sales opportunities. In Zoho CRM, leads are considered the raw details of a company, person or business opportunity.
</p>

<p>
Once you have a solid (and unambiguous) lead management process you can start to tackle activity management. This is what drives what we do next, when and why. Working in harmony, the lead and activity management processes can dramatically improve the productivity of your sales team, and increase executive management visibility into projected revenue. Remember that activity is the leading indicator of pipeline, and pipeline is the leading indicator of revenue.
</p>

So do your Lead Status pick-list values describe a ‘state’ that cannot be undone, or are they ambiguous descriptions understood and used differently across your organization?

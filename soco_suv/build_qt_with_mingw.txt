Qt works on windows with a bunch of compilers, msvcxx , mingw etc.
To use Qt libraries, it is necessary to build Qt with the
corresponding toolchains. The following is steps about how to build
Qt on windows with Mingw



=================

My successful steps towards a working Qwt plugin
Here's the protocol of my steps:

(I am using a fully updated Windows XP Professional SP3, German.
The following is all done with administrator rights, fwiw.)

Download qt-sdk-win-opensource-2010.05.exe from
http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/sdk-windows-cpp.
This contains mingw, the Qt libraries version 4.7.0 and
Qt Creator IDE version 2.0.1.

Install this to D:\Programme\Qt\2010.05\
Download qt-creator-2.0.1-src.zip from
http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/qt-creator-source-package

Unpack this to D:\Programme\qt-creator-2.0.1-src\
Add the line "CONFIG += release" to qtcreator.pro
(after "CONFIG += ordered"), just to be sure .

Create a new folder D:\Programme\qt-creator-2.0.1-build\
Enter the "Qt Command Prompt" via the Start menu and type:
 C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /A /Q /K
 <path to sdk>\Desktop\Qt\4.7.4\mingw\bin\qtenv2.bat
 *** there is no propritery  QT prompt com

Source code
1. D:\Programme\Qt\2010.05\qt>cd \Programme\qt-creator-2.0.1-build
2. D:\Programme\qt-creator-2.0.1-build>qmake ..\qt-creator-2.0.1-src\qtcreator.pro
3. D:\Programme\qt-creator-2.0.1-build>mingw32-make release

Now copy all non-debug dlls (i.e. *4.dll, but not *d4.dll)
from D:\Programme\Qt\2010.05\qt\bin\
to D:\Programme\qt-creator-2.0.1-build\bin\

(You might want to add the former folder to the PATH instead.)
Successfully start D:\Programme\Qt\2010.05\qt\bin\qtcreator.exe

A nice table of contents so that you can see what you’re getting into:
* optional
1.
Download the latest Qt source code and put it in its own directory.
 --you can get the entire SDK or  just the source code.
2.
*Modify the compiler flags for use when building Qt.
----the file is “C:\Qt\mkspecs\COMPILER\make.conf”, where COMPILER is :
“win32-g++” for GCC

3.
Open a command-line window for your compiler.
--- from startup run, run “mingwvars.bat”

4.
Configure.

--- configure -release  -nomake examples -nomake demos -no-exceptions -no-stl -no-rtti -no-qt3support -no-scripttools -no-openssl -no-opengl -no-webkit -no-phonon -no-style-motif -no-style-cde -no-style-cleanlooks -no-style-plastique -no-sql-sqlite
Add “-platform win32-???” for your compiler

5.
Compile.
*If you want to use static linking, modify your Qt project.
-- you will be informed of which command starts the actual compile (usually mingw32-make or
